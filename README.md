## Sample outpt

---------------BEGIN----------------

âž• Front desk staff was nice

TLDR: do yourself a favor, save your money, and do NOT book here
âž– The room REEKED of cigarette smoke, like someone had been chain smoking in there all day before we checked in. I tried fleeing to the bathroom to avoid the smell that was on the linens, but the bathtub was moldy and had hair in it and the toilet smelled like it hadnâ€™t been cleaned. Couldnâ€™t even stay the night, checked out a few hours after getting in. NOT what I wanted after being on the road all day. Iâ€™m at another hotel and the smell is still stuck in my nose. They donâ€™t offer refunds after you check in and now we know why. Itâ€™s cheap, but not that much cheaper. Go somewhere else ðŸ¤®
